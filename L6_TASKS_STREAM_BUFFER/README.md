# Example 6 Tasks
Playing with tasks and stream buffer.

Two tasks, one is writing to the stream buffer and one is reading from stream buffer.
The writing task is faster than the reader. This has an build in errors, 
when the buffer is full the writer cannot write to the buffer and gets a timeout for writing. 
This errors can be prevented by increasing the buffer size or the timeout of the writer.
